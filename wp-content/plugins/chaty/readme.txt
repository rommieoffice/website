= 💬 Connect with your website visitors on WhatsApp and 20+ chat channels =
Chaty is designed to help you connect on WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business with ease. Enter your WhatsApp number, and you’re all set. Use our advanced WhatsApp features like the WhatsApp popup that emulates a WhatsApp Chat window, WhatsApp Merge tags, WhatsApp agents, and many other features that’ll help you better communicate on WhatsApp.

= 📞 The ultimate click to chat and call now phone button =
Are you looking for a chat button or a click to call button? Want to make it easier for potential customers to contact you via WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, or other chat icons?

Chaty is the perfect chat plugin for you! With Chaty you can display a call widget, Whatsapp button, email button, SMS button, TikTok, Google Maps button, Vkontakte button, Line.me messenger button, Viber button, and other chat widgets. Your visitors are already using these chat apps, and most of them prefer to contact you using these chat apps. By using Chaty, you give your website visitors the option to chat with you after they leave your website. Want to use our robust Pro version? Check out <a href="https://premio.io/downloads/chaty/?utm_source=wordpressorg" target="_blank" title="Chaty pro plans"><strong>Chaty Pro Plans</strong></a>.

= 💪 What can you do with Chaty =

* Chaty VS live chat alternatives - give your visitors the option to use the chat channels they already use. When you use "regular" live chat alternatives, your visitors must stay on your website and wait for your response. When you let your visitors chat with you using chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, etc, you give them the freedom to chat with you wherever they go.
* A direct click to chat method - show your visitors the chat channels you're available on, and let them choose the chat app they prefer.
* WhatsApp Business - chat with your visitors on WhatsApp Business.
* Help your website visitors navigate to your physical address - you can use our Google Maps and Waze channels.
* Click to call - show a phone call icon and let your visitors click to call you. If you want to show different local phone numbers based on the page’s URL, you can use the multi widget Pro feature.
* Show different chat channels for different pages  - show separate widgets for different products on your website,  show different buttons based on URL for WPML or multi-language sites, display different channels for your landing pages, and more (Pro feature).
* Available days and hours - show the widget only during your opening hours. You can also use it to show live chat options when you're available, and other chat channels when you're not (Pro feature).
* Launch your favorite live chat app - you can use JavaScript as one of your chat channels to launch other live chat products like Tawk.to, Tidio, Chatra, Formilla, Zoho, Zendesk, LiveChat, Crisp, Intercom, JivoChat, Olark, and more.

> "Best Chat Tool I’ve Used<br>
> I’ve had to go through several chat plugins, and all of them have been a bit complicated to setup, don’t work very well, or don’t have the functionality I’m looking for. Chaty has been the only tool I’ve found to get the job done. But my favorite feature aside from how well it works, is the back-end interface. I wish more apps would consider making the backend interface as well as Premio does theirs. Kudos!"<br><br>
